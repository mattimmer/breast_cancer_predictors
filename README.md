There are three main files in this branch.  First is the Technical Summary.docx which contains the full research study analysis in report form.  The second file is the data that was used from this link https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data, in a file called data.csv.  The final piece is a rough outline of the code that was used in R/Rstudio to make these calculations for the final report.
Abstract
 
The determination of what type of tumor is one of the first steps that doctors applied after detecting it. For this examination, one sample is taken from the cells and is analyzed through a biopsy procedure. This paper studies the detection of the type of tumor following the measurements of the features of the breast mass cell nuclei.  Different methods were applied, such as linear regression, ridge and lasso regression, logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis. The  results obtained show the type of breast cancer can be predicted by a coefficient of a measurement from the image of the cell nuclei represented in our data.
